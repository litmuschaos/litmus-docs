> In the `/setup` route (Project Setup > Members on the sidebar) the `Active/Pending members` tabs can be used to access the teaming feature by the `owner`. We recommend learning about the concept of [teaming](../concepts/teaming.md) before proceeding with the following user guides.

With this feature, you can select as many users you want, choose their roles individually and send the invitation at once! Once it is done successfully you can see the status of the sent invitation (whether it is in a pending/accepted/declined or exited state) along with all the other necessary details in the `Pending members` tab.

## 1. Find the user you want to invite

In the team tab, click the `New member` button as shown below:

## 2. Select all the members to be invited

From the list of all available members, choose the ones you want to collaborate on your chaos with and decide what project level access they should have to your project (Viewer/Executor) and hit the same button.

On successful acceptance of the invitation you will be able to collaborate over your project!
