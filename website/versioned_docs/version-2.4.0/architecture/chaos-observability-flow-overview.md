Observability in Litmus serves a two-fold cause:

1. To provide the right hooks to APM platforms so as to enable visualization and understand the behavior of application/microservices under chaotic conditions.

2. Ability to gather, record & factor in data provided by standard observability frameworks as part of SLO validation in automated chaos experiment runs - the results of which can be stored & analyzed as experiment “verdicts” or “metadata”. 

Chaos Observability in Litmus can be sectioned into the following:
1. **[Visualising Chaos Workflow (Visualization)](chaos-observability-flow-visualization.md)** 
  - Workflow Execution Graph
2. **[Fetching Logs (Logging)](chaos-observability-flow-logging.md)**
  - Litmus Checker Logs
  - Experiment Logs
  - Non-Chaos Workflow Logs
3. **[Monitoring Systems in Real Time During Chaos (Monitoring)](chaos-observability-flow-monitoring.md)**
  - Metrics
  - Events
4. **[Viewing Experiment Verdict and Summary (Summarisation)](chaos-observability-flow-summarisation.md)**
  - Chaos Result
5. **[Post-Chaos Workflow Analytics (Analytics)](chaos-observability-flow-analytics.md)**
  - Workflow Statistics and Information
