You can save a schedule as a template for later usage in subsequent schedules. This section goes over the steps to achieve the same.

## Before you begin

You can learn how to schedule your first workflow [here](schedule-workflow.md).

## 1. Go to the workflows sections

In the `Workflows` page, go to the `Schedules` tab and click on the options menu for the specific schedule you wish to save as a template:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/injecting-fault/save-workflow-as-template/step-1.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />

## 2. Click on the `Save Template` option

After opening the options menu, click on the `Save Template` option. You will see the following modal popup. Here you can edit the workflow `YAML` and provide a name and description for the template you are creating:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/injecting-fault/save-workflow-as-template/step-2.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />

## 3. Save the changes

After having made all the changes you wish to preserve as a template, click the `Save Changes` button to save your template.

## 4. Use your new template

You can now see your template under the `Create a new workflow by cloning an existing workflow` option in the workflow scheduling steps and can directly use it for your chaos.
