You can leave a project that you no longer wish to be a part of.

## 1. Identify the project you want to leave

In the settings page, scroll to the very bottom of the `Team` tab. Here you will see a list of all the projects you are a part of, identify the project youâ€™d like to leave and click on the `Leave Project` button:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/managing-projects/leave-project/step-1.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />

> Note: Having left the project, the number of active projects will change and the project you left can no longer be observed as a currently active project in the `Team` tab

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/managing-projects/leave-project/step-2.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />
