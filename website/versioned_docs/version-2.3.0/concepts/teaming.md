The ChaosCenter has a built in teaming feature to facilitate collaboration between users using project level role access, the core concepts of which are discussed below.

## Project level roles (Owner, Editor, Viewer)

Each user has a default project created on user creation by the admin for which they maintain a project level `Owner` access. Every `Owner` has the ability to invite other users into their project with different permission levels, namely `Editor`, and `Viewer`.

Teaming is based on the following principles and each user can have one of the 3 project roles:

- **Owner:** One who created the project and owns it. Only the owner has permission to manage(invite or remove) the members in his/her project. The owner can schedule workflows, update workflows, delete workflows and view the analytics.
- **Editor:** Members invited with the editor role can do everything an owner can except for managing the project.
- **Viewer:** Members having a viewer role can only view the analytics related to the workflows and the workflows themselves, but are not given the permission to schedule workflows in the project.

## Role privileges

> Note: A user will be the owner of his/her project by default.

**_As the Project Owner you can:_**

- Invite other users for the following roles:
  - Viewer
  - Editor
- View the list of team members with other details including their role in the project, email-id, date-time of joining the project team.
- Rename your project.
- Remove a member from your project.
- Check the status of the invitation you sent to other members.
- Edit the user role in case the invitation is pending.
- Cancel the invitation.

**_As a Viewer or Editor you can:_**

- Check and Accept/Decline the received invitations.
- Switch and browse any project you are a member of.
- Can leave the project you are a part of, except your own.

> Note: The settings page will not be visible to you if you are browsing someone elseâ€™s project. You can only view it if you are the project owner.
