The Concepts section contains Definitions, Design principles, Terminology and Working technical theory. This section will not have the actual usage instructions or guides those will be made available in the [User Guides](../user-guides/overview.md) section.

### [Chaos Infrastructure](infrastructure.md)

Chaos infrastructure is a service that runs in your target environment and aids Litmus control plane in accessing and injecting chaos.

### [ChaosHub](chaoshub.md)

ChaosHub allows you to orchestrate chaos experiments from the Public **[ChaosHub](http://hub.litmuschaos.io/)** or an alternate source for the Faults.

### [Chaos Experiment](chaos-workflow.md)

Chaos Experiment is a set of different operations coupled together to achieve desired chaos impact on a Kubernetes Cluster.

### [Resilience Probes](probes.md)

Probes are pluggable checks that can be defined within the ChaosEngine for any Chaos Fault.

### [User Management](user-management.md)

Role Privileges of different users in the ChaosCenter.

### [Projects](projects.md)

Project management system which can be used for working on chaos experiment with multiple different projects across different chaos infrastructures.

### [Teaming](probes.md)

Teaming feature to facilitate collaboration between users using project level role access.

### [GitOps](gitops.md)

GitOps feature in Litmus enables you to configure a single source of truth for your chaos experiments and faults.

### [Authentication in ChaosCenter](oauth-dex-concept.md)

Authentication in ChaosCenter supports both local and OAuth-based authentication through the Authentication Server and Dex OIDC Server, offering enhanced flexibility and secure access management.

### [Visualize Chaos Experiment](visualize-experiment.md)

ChaosCenter enables users to visualize the execution of chaos experiments in real-time, displaying key details like step statuses, logs, and results. This visualization helps in analyzing the impact and resiliency of the experiment, with graphs showing the experimentâ€™s progress and individual node information.
