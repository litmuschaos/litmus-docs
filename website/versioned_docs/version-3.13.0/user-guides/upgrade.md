## Upgrade ChaosCenter

To upgrade Litmus ChaosCenter from 3.8.0 to 3.9.0, you can follow these steps:

> Note: This step is not required if using Helm, Helm upgrade should work.

1. Upgrade the control plane (ChaosCenter)
   To upgrade ChaosCenter, you can re-apply the manifest using the kubectl.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/3.13.0/litmus-getting-started.yaml
   ```

## Upgrade Chaos Delegate

To upgrade your Chaos Delegate, you can follow these steps:

1. If an upgrade is available, you will get an option to upgrade your chaos delegate in the ChaosCenter. Upon clicking on the upgrade option, a modal will pop up providing you the litmusctl command which you can execute and your Chaos Delegate will be upgraded.

Alternatively you can run the following command using litmusctl in the cluster containing the chaos delegate by providing `<CLUSTER_ID>` and `<PROJECT_ID>`.

```
litmusctl upgrade agent --cluster-id="<CLUSTER_ID>" --project-id="<PROJECT_ID>"
```

> Note: v0.7.0 of [litmusctl](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmusctl/blob/master/README.md) is required.
