You can save a schedule configurations manifest as a `YAML`. This section goes over the steps to achieve the same.

## Before you begin

You can learn how to schedule your first chaos scenario [here](schedule-workflow.md).

## 1. Go to the chaos scenarios sections

In the `Chaos Scenario` page, go to the `Schedules` tab and click on the options menu for the specific schedule you wish to download the manifest for:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/injecting-fault/download-workflow-manifest/step-1.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />

## 2. Click on the `Download Manifest` option

After opening the options menu, click on the `Download Manifest` option. Having downloaded a particular schedule manifest, you can see the browser downloads list to see the status of the manifest download operation and then see the `YAML` file in your system's default download directory:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/injecting-fault/download-workflow-manifest/step-2.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />
