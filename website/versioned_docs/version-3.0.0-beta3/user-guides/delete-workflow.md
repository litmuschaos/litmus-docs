If required, it is possible to delete a chaos scenario schedule that you no longer wish to run against your application.

:::note
This also means that all the runs corresponding to that chaos scenario will also be deleted.

## Before you begin

You can learn about the concept of chaos scenarios [here](../concepts/chaos-workflow.md) and how to schedule your first chaos scenario [here](schedule-workflow.md).

## 1. Go to the chaos scenarios sections

In the `Chaos Scenario` page, go to the `Schedules` tab and click on the options menu for the specific schedule you wish to delete:

## 2. Click on the `Delete chaos scenario` option

After opening the options menu and clicking on the `Delete chaos scenario` option, you'll see a prompt in order to confirm your action. Please ensure that you want to delete the selected chaos scenario and click the `Delete` button:

## 3. The Chaos Scenario has been deleted

You will observe that the chaos scenario no longer appears in the list of schedules and has been removed.
