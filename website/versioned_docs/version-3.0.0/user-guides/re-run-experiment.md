You can re-run any **_non-recurring_** schedule should you wish to test your application against it at any point.

## Before you begin

You can learn how to schedule your first chaos scenario [here](schedule-experiment.md).

## 1. Go to the chaos scenarios sections

In the `Chaos Scenario` page, go to the `Schedules` tab and click on the options menu for the specific schedule you wish to re-run:

## 2. Click on the `Rerun Schedule` option

After opening the options menu, click on the `Rerun Schedule` option. Having re-run a particular schedule, you can switch to the `Runs` tab and see that it has started to re-run as per the schedule configurations:
