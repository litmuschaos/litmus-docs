You can re-run any **_non-recurring_** schedule should you wish to test your application against it at any point.

## Before you begin

You can learn how to schedule your first chaos experiment [here](schedule-experiment.md).

## 1. Go to the chaos experiments sections

In the `Chaos experiment` page, and click on the play icon for the specific schedule you wish to re-run:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/injecting-fault/re-run-workflow/step-1.png').default} />

## 2. Click on the `Run Experiment` option

Having re-run a particular experiment, you will redirected to the chaos studio for the particular execution and see that it has started to run as per the experiment configurations:
