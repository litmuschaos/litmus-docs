Chaos infrastructure is a service that runs in your target environment and aids the Litmus control plane in accessing and injecting chaos at a cloud-native scale. All the chaos infrastructure services adhere to the principle of least privilege, where the services execute with the minimum number of required permissions. A Chaos Infrastructure can be created under a Chaos Environment.


:::note
With the latest release of LitmusChaos 3.0.0 the term **Chaos Delegate/Agent** has been changed to **Chaos Infrastructure**

## Chaos Environment

An environment represents where you are installing your Chaos Infrastructure acts as an additional level of abstraction for the same. You categorize each environment as prod or non-prod.

### Access Types

Chaos Infrastructure can be created in two modes:

<li><b>Cluster Wide:</b> This mode of infrastructure installation allows targeting resources across the entire cluster, in all the namespaces, as part of an experiment.</li> 
<li><b>Namespace Mode:</b> This mode of infrastructure installation allows targeting resources only in the namespace where the chaos infrastructure is deployed.</li>

:::note

 <li>There can only be one cluster-wide chaos infrastructure per cluster.</li>
 <li>There may be multiple namespace-scoped chaos infrastructures per cluster.</li>
