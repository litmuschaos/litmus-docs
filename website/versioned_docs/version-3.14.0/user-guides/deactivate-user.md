The Account of a created user can be deactivated, if required. Once the user is deactivated, the user wonâ€™t be able to log in or access any of the APIs. Along with this, the user's project where they have Owner permission will also get deactivated and everyone who is a member of that project will lose access to it. The admin user can also reactivate the account of a deactivated user. Once the user is reactivated, all of their data will get restored.

## 1. Locate and deactivate the user

In the user management tab, locate the user account that you'd like to deactivate and click on the horizontal options icon.

## 2. Confirm the deactivation

On clicking on the **Disable User** option, a confirmation prompt will pop up, click on the **Confirm** button in order to disable the user.

## 3. Re-activate a user (Optional step)

Similarly, the admin user can re-activate the user from the same drop-down menu as shown:
