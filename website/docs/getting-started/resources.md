## ChaosCenter

The <span style={{color: '#5B44BA'}}>**ChaosCenter**</span> is a single source of truth to control all the different Chaos Activities happening around Litmus. From the ChaosCenter you get the freedom to manage every single part of Litmus and shape your chaos scenarios exactly the way you want it.

**ChaosCenter comes pre-packaged** as a part of LitmusChaos installation and can be easily accessed via [Ingress](../user-guides/setup-with-ingress.md), [NodePort](../user-guides/setup-without-ingress.md#with-nodeport) or [LoadBalancer](../user-guides/setup-without-ingress.md#with-loadbalancer). Since Litmus has Cross-Cloud support, you get seamless access to the ChaosCenter irrespectively of where you deploy it.

## Chaos Delegates

A <span style={{color: '#5B44BA'}}>**Chaos Delegate**</span> in Litmus is nothing but the target cluster where Chaos would be injected via Litmus. There should always be at least one or more than one Chaos Delegates connected to the ChaosCenter. Each individual Chaos Delegate can be chosen to be the Chaos Delegate for Chaos Injection.

## Types of Chaos Delegates

In Litmus, Chaos Delegates can be classified into two types

- <span style={{color: '#5B44BA'}}><b>Self Chaos Delegate</b></span>
- <span style={{color: '#5B44BA'}}><b>External Chaos Delegate</b></span>

As part of the Litmus installation, a Self Chaos Delegate would be registered as a default Chaos Delegate in the ChaosCenter. The same cluster where Litmus is installed is chosen as the Self Chaos Delegate by the installer. From the ChaosCenter you can now induce chaos into this Self Chaos Delegate and observe the results.

Since the ChaosCenter is Cross Cloud, you can connect multiple external Chaos Delegates to the same with the help of the command line utility [litmusctl](../litmusctl/installation.md). Once connected you can manage, monitor, observe and induce chaos from the ChaosCenter to the respective Chaos Delegates.
