## Before you begin

You can learn about the concept of resilience probes [here](../concepts/probes.md) and chaos experiments [here](../concepts/chaos-workflow.md). 

Here are some characterstics of resilience probes.
- **Unique Identifier**: Each Resilience Probe is identified by a unique name, serving as its identifier. Probe names cannot be reused for a given fault.
- **Deletion Behavior**: Deleting a Resilience Probe will disable it from further use but does not delete it from the system. This ensures that the probe's history and configuration remain intact for reference and analysis.

For this user guide, we will use a HTTP probe.

## 1. Go to the Resilience Probes section

Navigate to the `/probes` page (Resilience Probes on the left nav), and click on the `New Probe` button

## 2. Select the type of probe

Select and click on the type of probe you would like to create, you can read about the available probe types [here](../concepts/probes.md)

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/resilience-probes/create-probe/step-2.png').default} />

## 3. Enter the details of the probe to create

Enter the details of the probe such as name, description (optional), tags (optional)

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/resilience-probes/create-probe/step-3.png').default} />

## 4. Configure the probe properties

Configure the properties for the probe you are creating, such as, Timeout, Interval, Retry, etc.

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/resilience-probes/create-probe/step-4.png').default} />

## 5. Configure the probe details

Configure the details for the probe you are creating, once completed, click the `Setup Probe` button

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/resilience-probes/create-probe/step-5.png').default} />

The new probe will appear in the list as shown:

### Experiment Creation

When creating an experiment, it's imperative to include the Resilience Probe as part of the setup. This step is now mandatory to ensure accurate chaos injection and monitoring during the experiment.
> **Note:** Starting from this version, at least one Resilience Probe must be added to each fault.



### Annotations for Experiment Configuration

When creating experiments, it's crucial to include a probeRef in annotations to link Resilience Probes with the experiment. This step enables seamless integration of probes into the chaos engineering workflow, whether creating experiments manually or uploading YAML configurations.

Example YAML manifest:
``` yaml
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: example-chaos-engine
  namespace: litmus
spec:
  appinfo: 
    appns: 'litmus'
    applabel: 'app=nginx'
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  monitoring: false
  jobCleanUpPolicy: retain
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "30"
            - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
              value: "10"
            - name: FORCE
              value: "true"
        annotationCheck: 'true'
        components:
          - name: runner
            value: "go"
```
> **Note:** Add essential annotations, like annotationCheck: 'true', in the experiment's spec section to connect the Resilience Probe with the experiment and activate validation of the experiment configuration.Feel free to customize the YAML manifest according to your specific experiment requirements and configuration.

1. **Identify Probe to Associate**: Determine the Resilience Probe that you want to associate with the experiment.

2. **Add probeRef in Annotations**: In the experiment YAML configuration, include a `probeRef` field in annotations and specify the name of the Resilience Probe. Ensure that the `probeRef` is correctly formatted and matches the name of the chosen probe.

3. **Validate Annotations**: Before initiating the experiment, validate the experiment YAML configuration to ensure that the `probeRef` is properly included and associated with the Resilience Probe.
