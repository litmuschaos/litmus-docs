:::note
Deleting a probe will delete all the associations with experiment runs from the chaos control plane. This will also misplace any analytics that had incurred for the previous runs for said probe.
:::

## 1. Go to the probes sections

In the `Resilience Probes` page, go to the specific probe you wish to delete:
