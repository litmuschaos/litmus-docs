Owners have the ability to change the name of their project if they wish to do so.

## Before you begin

The concept of `Projects` is discussed [here](../concepts/projects.md) and will help you build a foundational understanding of what projects mean in the ChaosCenter.

## Steps

### 1. Go to `Account setting`

Go to the `Overview` section of settings and scroll to the `Your Projects` section:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/managing-projects/change-project-name/step-1.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />

### 2. Enter edit mode

Click options icon to open the options menu and click on the edit option (demonstrated in this example as `admin-project`) to enter the edit mode:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/managing-projects/change-project-name/step-2.png').default} />

### 3. Replace name

Once in the editing mode, type out the name you want to replace the current name with, and click on the `Confirm` button.
