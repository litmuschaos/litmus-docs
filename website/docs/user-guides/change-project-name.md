## Steps

Owners have the ability to change the name of their project by following the steps below:

### 1. Go to `My Project`

Go to the `Team` section of settings and scroll to the `My project` section:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/managing-projects/change-project-name/step-1.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />

### 2. Enter edit mode

Click on either the text (demonstrated in this example as `admin’s project`) or on the edit icon next to it to enter the edit mode:

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/managing-projects/change-project-name/step-2.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />

### 3. Replace name

Once in the editing mode, type out the name you want to replace the current name with, and click away anywhere in the screen. You will notice that the name of the project has been changed in the `My Project` section as well as the header of the portal.

<img src={require('../assets/user-guides/managing-projects/change-project-name/step-3.png').default} width="1000" height="500" />
