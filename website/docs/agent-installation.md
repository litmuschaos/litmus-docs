In Litmus the Agents can be classified as two types

- Self Agent
- External Agent

As part of Litmus installation by default, a self cluster would be registered as Agent in the Portal. From Portal you induce chaos into self cluster and observe the results from the Portal.

As you are aware by now, Portal is a Cross Cloud Chaos Control plane. That is you can connect multiple external kubernetes agents to this portal. Once connected you can manage the chaos from the Portal that is you can induce chaos into this agent from the Portal and observe the results from the Portal. Using the command line utility *litmusctl* you can connect the external agents to the Portal.
